.. _tei_output:

`TEI <http://www.tei-c.org/>`_ is a consortium maintaining standards for the
representation of texts in digital form which are widely used in the
humanities. Nidaba is capable of encoding the OCR results and their metadata
into XML documents following the most recent `P5 guidelines
<http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/>`_. The output is designed to facilitate
further manual annotation.

Format
======

Fundamentally output is generated following the `embedded transcription
<http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html#PHZLAB>`_ scheme
with a single surface containing all recognized line elements with their
textual representation. When merging the output of multiple OCR engines
diverging ``readings`` will be attributed to their origin using the
``respStmt`` tag. Alternative spellings provided by a spell checker will also
be properly attributed.

The skeleton of a TEI-OCR file will look like this::

        <sourceDoc>
                <surface ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="500" lry="500">
                        <graphic url="foo.png"/>
                        <zone>
                                <line ulx=a uly=b lrx=c lry=d>text...</line>
                                ...
                        </zone>
                </surface>
        </sourceDoc>
